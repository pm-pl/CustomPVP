## 📫 • General:

 - Plugin Introduction: 

   > This is an advanced plugin to manage pvp on your minecraft bedrock server, this plugin is public and the best for this area, with this plugin you can enjoy great original and even improved features for the latest api, hope you like it!

 - Change Logs:

   > After several tests the ```ping kick```, ```kill rewards``` and ```Death Effects``` were removed due to instability that directly affected other plugins!

   > Activating all addons can cause severe errors already confirmed in tests, I suggest not doing this and also not activating multiple addons for the same world!
